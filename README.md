## üñºÔ∏è Monet Art Viewer

A Python GUI application that displays a paginated gallery of Monet artworks from the Art Institute of Chicago's public API. Built with Tkinter, Pillow, and Requests, it offers a scrollable view of artwork cards, each showing image, title, medium, dimensions, and description.
